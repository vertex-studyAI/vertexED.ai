          Strong content knowledge is essential, but exams reward precision under time pressure. This
          guide converts marking schemes and command terms into concrete behaviors you can practice each
          week, so exam day feels like a familiar routine—not a surprise.
        </p>

        <h2>Decode the paper before you start</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Scan sections:</strong> Identify mandatory vs optional questions.</li>
          <li><strong>Budget time:</strong> A simple rule is ~1 minute per mark plus a small buffer.</li>
          <li><strong>Spot traps:</strong> Multi‑part items often hide easy marks in (a); secure these early.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Command terms → behaviors</h2>
        <p>
          Command terms map to expected depth: “Define” (precise wording), “Explain” (cause → effect →
          link), “Evaluate” (criteria + judgment), “Compare” (similarities/differences with structure).
          Build a personal checklist for 5–7 common terms in your subjects.
        </p>

        <h2>Timing drills with VertexED</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Weekly mini‑papers:</strong> Use <Link to="/paper-maker">Paper Maker</Link> to generate 20–30
            marks worth of items. Set a visible timer and practice moving on when time is up.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Rapid review:</strong> Immediately paste 1–2 answers into the
            <Link to="/answer-reviewer"> Answer Reviewer</Link> and compare feedback to your self‑assessment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Schedule the cycle:</strong> Add a Friday “timed set” and Sunday “review + fixes” in the
            <Link to="/planner"> Planner</Link> each week.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Mark schemes as checklists</h2>
        <p>
          Turn mark scheme patterns into short checklists. For example, a 6‑mark “Explain” might require
          mechanism, two consequences, limitations, and a linking statement. Train yourself to scan your
          answer against the checklist in 20–30 seconds before moving on.
        </p>

        <h2>Common timing mistakes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Spending too long perfecting early answers; starving later questions.</li>
          <li>Skipping easy definition marks because they look “too simple.”</li>
          <li>Not leaving a 5‑minute end buffer for quick gains and obvious fixes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Build exam stamina</h2>
        <p>
          Once a fortnight, simulate a longer session (45–60 minutes) to practice focus and pacing. Use
          interleaved topics to mirror real papers and condition the switch‑cost of changing contexts.
        </p>

        <h2>Template: 30‑mark timed set</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Q1: Definitions/short items (6–8 marks) — secure these in ~6–7 minutes.</li>
          <li>Q2: Data/diagram or structured response (10–12 marks) — outline then write, 12–13 minutes.</li>
          <li>Q3: Extended response (10 marks) — thesis, 2–3 arguments with evidence, conclusion, 10 minutes.</li>
        </ul>

          Paper formats and mark schemes vary by year and board. Treat this guide as practical strategy; always verify
          specifics against your current syllabus and official past papers.

          use your board’s mark scheme as the source of truth.
