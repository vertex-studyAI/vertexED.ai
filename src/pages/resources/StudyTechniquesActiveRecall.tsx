          If you’ve ever reread a chapter and felt confident right until the test, you’ve met the
          illusion of competence. Active recall and spaced repetition cut through that illusion by
          forcing memory retrieval and distributing practice over time. The result: higher retention,
          better transfer on exam day, and less total study time.
        </p>

        <h2>What is active recall?</h2>
        <p>
          Active recall is the simple act of trying to remember without looking. Instead of highlighting
          or rereading, you answer questions, recite concepts, draw diagrams, or write mini‑explanations
          from memory. This retrieval strengthens the memory trace and reveals genuine gaps.
        </p>
        <p>
          In VertexED, the fastest way to switch to active recall is to convert your notes into
          flashcards or quizzes, then attempt them cold. You can do this directly with the
          <Link to="/notetaker"> Notetaker</Link> → <em>Flashcards</em> workflow, or paste topics into the
          <Link to="/study-zone"> Study Zone</Link> to generate quick quizzes.
        </p>

        <h2>Why spaced repetition works</h2>
        <p>
          The spacing effect shows that information reviewed after forgetting begins accelerates learning.
          Short, distributed sessions outperform long, massed ones. Spaced repetition sets the next review
          right before you would otherwise forget, tightening the feedback loop.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Day 0:</strong> Learn the concept and attempt recall once.</li>
          <li><strong>Day 1–2:</strong> Short review of misses and shaky items.</li>
          <li><strong>Day 5–7:</strong> Mixed quiz pulling from multiple topics.</li>
          <li><strong>Day 14+:</strong> Interleaved retrieval with exam‑style prompts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Interleaving beats blocking</h2>
        <p>
          Blocking is practicing one type of problem repeatedly. Interleaving mixes topics and question
          types. It feels harder but improves discrimination and transfer. For IB/IGCSE, interleaving
          mirrors papers where command terms, representations, and contexts shift from item to item.
        </p>

        <h2>Implement it in VertexED</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Create recall materials:</strong> Use <Link to="/notetaker">Notetaker</Link> to turn notes into
            flashcards. Or, type topics into <Link to="/study-zone">Study Zone</Link> to generate quiz items.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Schedule spaced blocks:</strong> In the <Link to="/planner">Planner</Link>, create short
            sessions (20–30 min) for each subject across the week. Tag sessions with topics so VertexED can
            balance distribution.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mix in exam prompts:</strong> Use the <Link to="/paper-maker">Paper Maker</Link> weekly to
            generate 1–2 short exam‑style questions per topic and attempt them under light time pressure.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Close the loop:</strong> Paste your answers into the
            <Link to="/answer-reviewer"> Answer Reviewer</Link> for rubric‑style feedback and targeted fixes.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Sample weekly template</h2>
        <p>Here’s a simple distribution that fits a busy week:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mon:</strong> Chemistry flashcards (20m) + mixed recall quiz (10m)</li>
          <li><strong>Tue:</strong> History command terms drill (25m) + brief self‑explanations (5m)</li>
          <li><strong>Wed:</strong> Math interleaved problem set (30m)</li>
          <li><strong>Thu:</strong> Biology flashcards (15m) + exam prompt (10m)</li>
          <li><strong>Fri:</strong> Paper Maker mini‑set (30m)</li>
          <li><strong>Sun:</strong> Weekly mixed review (30–40m)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Don’t review everything every day—space it.</li>
          <li>Don’t only do recognition—force production (explain/write/solve).</li>
          <li>Don’t avoid errors—use them to tune the next session.</li>
          <li>Don’t keep cards too easy—rewrite to demand recall and reasoning.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>IB/IGCSE‑specific tips</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>IB command terms:</strong> Convert terms (e.g., “Evaluate”, “Discuss”) into prompts and rate your own depth/criteria each attempt.</li>
          <li><strong>IGCSE definitions:</strong> Use precise phrasing; add marking keywords to flashcards so you practice exact wording.</li>
          <li><strong>Diagrams/data:</strong> Practice reconstructing graphs or labeled diagrams from memory before checking references.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <p><strong>How many cards per subject?</strong> Start with 30–50 high‑value cards that cover definitions, formulas, and common misconceptions. Grow slowly.</p>
        <p><strong>How long should sessions be?</strong> 20–30 minutes is enough for focused recall. Stop before fatigue kills quality.</p>
        <p><strong>What about burnout?</strong> Mix modalities—verbal explanation, drawing, and mixed quizzes keep energy higher than pure reading.</p>
