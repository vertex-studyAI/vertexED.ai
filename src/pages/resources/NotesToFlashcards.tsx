        <p>
          Most students collect notes; fewer turn them into practice. VertexED solves that gap with a
          streamlined Notetaker that transforms raw material into structured summaries, spaced‑repetition
          flashcards, and quick quizzes — all in the same flow. The goal isn’t just to write more notes; it’s
          to learn faster with fewer steps.
        </p>

        <h2>What you can do with VertexED</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Capture</strong> lecture text, textbook excerpts, or transcripts from short audio recordings.</li>
          <li><strong>Structure</strong> using Smart Notes, Cornell, Quick bullets, or Mapping formats.</li>
          <li><strong>Generate</strong> flashcards automatically from highlights or headings.</li>
          <li><strong>Practice</strong> with instant quizzes that mirror what your flashcards target.</li>
          <li><strong>Review</strong> on a spaced schedule coordinated by the <Link to="/planner">AI Study Planner</Link>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>A complete workflow (10–20 minutes)</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Start a topic.</strong> In the Notetaker, type your topic (e.g., “Photosynthesis Calvin Cycle”) and
            pick a note format. Smart Notes works well for quick study; Cornell is great for classes where you’ll add
            questions and cues later.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Add source material.</strong> Paste a short excerpt (100–500 words) or drop a brief audio clip.
            VertexED transcribes and cleans the text so you don’t waste time formatting.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Refine.</strong> Use the built‑in editor to tighten long sentences, add headings, or mark key ideas
            with a single click. The “Key points” action extracts exam‑relevant lines automatically.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Make flashcards.</strong> Select highlights → “Make flashcards”. VertexED generates front/back pairs
            that focus on definitions, relationships, and typical exam prompts. You can edit the front to be more
            challenging (cloze deletions work well).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Quick quiz.</strong> Switch to Quiz to create a short check (3–7 items). This closes the loop on the
            same session, so you don’t leave with an illusion of learning.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Schedule the review.</strong> Send the deck to the <Link to="/planner">Planner</Link>. VertexED places
            micro‑reviews on your calendar right before your forgetting curve dips.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Card styles that score marks</h2>
        <p>
          Not all cards are equal. The best cards ask for a single, verifiable answer you’d expect to see on an
          exam. VertexED helps you create three reliable types:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Definition → term</strong>: “Where does the Calvin cycle occur?” → “In the stroma.”
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cause → effect</strong>: “Increasing substrate concentration up to Vmax affects rate how?”
            → “Rate increases then plateaus as enzyme sites saturate.”
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Compare/contrast</strong>: “Paper 1 vs Paper 2 question style in IB History?” → “Source analysis vs
            essay‑based arguments.”
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Write better prompts (with cloze)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>One fact per card:</strong> Split compound ideas into separate prompts.</li>
          <li><strong>Force production:</strong> Ask “Explain how/why…” not “What is…?” when depth is needed.</li>
          <li><strong>Cloze example:</strong> “Photosynthesis occurs in the <code>{"{{stroma}}"}</code> and <code>{"{{thylakoid}}"}</code> (fill blanks).”</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Deck strategy</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Small and sharp:</strong> Keep 30–50 high‑value cards per subject to start.</li>
          <li><strong>Tag by topic:</strong> Use tags (e.g., “waves”, “cold‑war”) to target weak areas.</li>
          <li><strong>Retire fluff:</strong> Archive cards that always feel trivial.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>From flashcards to quizzes</h2>
        <p>
          Quizzes inside VertexED are intentionally short and targeted. The system converts your cards into mixed
          formats (MCQ, short answer) so you feel exam pressure without a 90‑minute commitment. Use one quiz per
          topic block, then recess with a timer in the <Link to="/study-zone">Study Zone</Link>.
        </p>

        <h2>Review intervals (practical)</h2>
        <p>
          A simple cadence works well: Day 0 learn, Day 2 review misses, Day 6 mixed quiz, Day 14 interleaved review.
          The <Link to="/planner">Planner</Link> schedules this automatically given your calendar.
        </p>

        <h2>Spaced review without spreadsheets</h2>
        <p>
          You don’t need to micro‑manage intervals. When you send a deck to the Planner, VertexED schedules reviews
          across days or weeks based on your availability and exam date. If you miss a session, it gently reschedules
          — no guilt, no lost streaks.
        </p>

        <h2>Example: 15‑minute Biology block</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Paste a 200‑word excerpt on the light‑dependent reactions.</li>
          <li>Auto‑summarise to Smart Notes; mark 5 key lines.</li>
          <li>Generate 6 flashcards (definitions + one compare/contrast).</li>
          <li>Run a 5‑question quiz; note one gap for review.</li>
          <li>Send deck to Planner; a 3‑minute micro‑review appears two days later.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Why VertexED is the solution</h2>
        <p>
          Tools that separate notes, cards, and quizzes create friction. VertexED combines them so you never break
          flow: capture → structure → recall → schedule. Because everything lives in one workspace, you spend time on
          ideas, not imports and exports.
        </p>

        <h3>Benefits at a glance</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Zero switching cost: notes, cards, quizzes, planner in one place.</li>
          <li>Cleaner prompts: AI suggestions emphasise exam‑scorable facts.</li>
          <li>Calendar‑aware spaced repetition: no more manual intervals.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <p><strong>How long should I spend per deck?</strong> 10–20 minutes per session is enough for quality recall.</p>
        <p><strong>When do I add more cards?</strong> Only when old ones feel solid during reviews or after a quiz.</p>
        <p><strong>Can I export?</strong> Use summaries to copy essentials; most learners benefit from keeping practice inside VertexED.</p>

        <h2>Get started</h2>
        <p>
          Open the Notetaker, choose a topic, and try a three‑card deck. If it feels easy, increase the specificity of
          your prompts or add a contrast card. In a week you’ll have a small, high‑quality deck — the kind that wins
          points on exam day.
