        <p className="opacity-90 text-base md:text-lg mb-8">
          Vertex began as an Oakridge 2025 Codefest idea — three classmates building a seamless AI study workspace. We study at the same school and crafted Vertex to bring planning, notes, flashcards, quizzes, and AI help into one elegant experience. After receiving over $500 in prize money at Bangalore's largest overnight hackathon for high schoolers, we decided to turn our vision into reality and create the ultimate study companion for students worldwide.
