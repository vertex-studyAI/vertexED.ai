{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: \"Explain why the discriminant matters for quadratics and how to use it.\",","completion":"Discriminant = b^2 - 4ac. Quick idea: it tells whether the parabola crosses the x-axis. If >0 you get two distinct real roots (it cuts twice), =0 means it just touches (double root), <0 means no real x-intercepts (complex roots). Why this works: the quadratic formula uses sqrt(discriminant) — if that radicand is negative there’s no real square root. Practical tip: compute Δ first to decide if factoring or formula is needed. Also Δ=perfect square → roots rational if coefficients integer. Want a short practice? (yes / no)","subject":"math","grade_level":"10","difficulty":"easy","format":"explanation"}
{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: \"Solve x^2+3x-10=0 and explain each choice step.\",","completion":"See if it factors: we need m*n=-10 and m+n=3. Pairs: (5,-2) works. So (x+5)(x-2)=0 → x=-5 or 2. Why factoring first: faster and gives intuition; if factors don't exist, use quadratic formula. Final answer: x=-5, 2. Want a similar factoring problem? (yes / no)","subject":"math","grade_level":"9","difficulty":"easy","format":"worked_solution"}
{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: \"Explain what eigenvalues and eigenvectors are, simply.\",","completion":"Eigenvectors are directions a linear transformation stretches or shrinks without rotating; eigenvalues are the scale factors. Mathematically A v = λ v: apply matrix A to v and you get λ times v. Why it matters: they reveal natural modes — vibrations, principal components, and long-term dynamics. Intuition: think of stretching a rubber sheet — eigenvectors are the directions that line up with the stretch. Quick use: diagonalize matrices, simplify powers of A, analyze stability. Want a short example? (yes / no)","subject":"math","grade_level":"12","difficulty":"medium","format":"explanation"}
{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: \"Explain Lagrange multipliers in one practical line and an example.\",","completion":"Lagrange multipliers let you optimize a function subject to a constraint by solving ∇f = λ∇g — geometrically, optimum occurs where level curves are tangent to the constraint. Example: maximize area xy with x+ y = 10 gives x=y=5. Why it works: gradient points normal to level sets so tangency forces no allowable small move increases f. Want the worked steps? (yes / no)","subject":"math","grade_level":"12","difficulty":"medium","format":"explanation"}
{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: \"Explain how to set up integration by parts and why it undoes product rule.\",","completion":"Integration by parts is∫u dv = uv - ∫v du — it reverses product rule d(uv)=u dv + v du. Why use it: when integrand is product of two functions where one simplifies when differentiated and the other is easy to integrate. Example: ∫x e^x dx: let u=x (du=dx), dv=e^x dx (v=e^x) →=x e^x - ∫e^x dx = x e^x - e^x + C. Final tip: choose u to reduce complexity on differentiation. Want another? (yes / no)","subject":"math","grade_level":"11","difficulty":"medium","format":"explanation"}
{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: \"Explain the difference between pointwise and uniform convergence (brief).\",","completion":"Pointwise: each x has sequence values converging; uniform: convergence happens uniformly across x with one rate. Intuition: pointwise may converge slowly somewhere; uniform controls error with a single N for all x. Why it matters: uniform allows interchange of limit operations (integration, continuity), pointwise might break them. Quick example: sequence f_n(x)=x^n on [0,1] converges pointwise to function that is 0 on [0,1) and 1 at x=1 — not uniform. Want a tiny problem?

{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: \"Compute definite integral of 0 to 1 of x^2 dx and explain steps.\",","completion":"Antiderivative of x^2 is x^3/3. Evaluate between 0 and 1: 1^3/3 - 0 = 1/3. Why antiderivative: Fundamental Theorem connects integral to area under curve and antiderivatives. Final: 1/3. Want a practice integral? (yes / no)","subject":"math","grade_level":"9","difficulty":"easy","format":"worked_solution"}
{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: \"Explain how to find the slope between two points; mention right-to-left rule.\",","completion":"Slope = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1). Right-to-left works because sign flips in numerator and denominator cancel. Example: (2,5) & (6,1): 1-5=-4, 6-2=4 → slope -1. Why: slope measures rise over run; algebraically it's change in y per change in x. Always label which point is which. Final: -1. Want another pair? (yes / no)","subject":"math","grade_level":"8","difficulty":"easy","format":"explanation"}
{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: \"Explain conservation of energy in mechanical systems — simple and why potential energy exists.\",","completion":"Energy conservation: total mechanical energy (KE + PE) stays constant in absence of non-conservative forces. Potential energy exists when forces are conservative (path-independent) so you can assign a scalar PE whose change equals negative work done by the force. Example: for gravity near Earth PE = mgh because work depends only on height change. Why useful: convert between kinetic and potential to solve motion without solving forces step-by-step. Want a short problem? (yes / no)","subject":"physics","grade_level":"10","difficulty":"easy","format":"explanation"}
{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: \"Derive v^2 = u^2 + 2as quickly and explain each algebraic step.\",","completion":"Start with v = u + at. Multiply both sides by v: v^2 = uv + avt. That’s messy — better: multiply v = u + at by (v - u): v^2 - u^2 = (v - u)(u + at). But (v-u)(u+at) = (v-u)u + a t (v-u). Not clean. Cleaner standard route: a = (v - u)/t → v = u + at. Multiply both sides by 2a: 2a(v - u) = 2a^2 t. Alternatively use s = ut + 1/2 a t^2, eliminate t. Solve for t from v = u + at → t = (v - u)/a. Plug into s: s = u (v - u)/a + 1/2 a (v - u)^2/a^2 → simplify gives v^2 = u^2 + 2as. The key: eliminate time to relate velocities and displacement. Want a practice kinematics? (yes / no)","subject":"physics","grade_level":"10","difficulty":"medium","format":"explanation"}
{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: \"Explain why momentum is conserved in collisions and when it may fail.\",","completion":"Momentum conservation follows from Newton's 3rd law and closed system: internal forces are equal and opposite so total momentum change cancels. It may fail if external forces act (friction, external pushes) or if mass is not constant within system. Inelastic vs elastic: momentum still conserved even if kinetic energy not; kinetic energy only conserved in elastic collisions. Practical tip: pick system so external impulses negligible over collision time. Want a collision problem? (yes / no)","subject":"physics","grade_level":"11","difficulty":"medium","format":"explanation"}
{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: \"Explain the photoelectric effect and why it proved light's particle side.\",","completion":"Photoelectric effect: shining light on a metal ejects electrons only if photon energy (hf) exceeds work function. Key facts: increased intensity raises current but not electron energy; increasing frequency raises kinetic energy of emitted electrons. That contradicts classical wave expectation (would predict energy depends on intensity). Einstein explained it by quantizing light into photons with energy hf. Why it matters: showed light has particle nature and led to quantum theory. Want a short calculation for cutoff frequency? (yes / no)","subject":"physics","grade_level":"12","difficulty":"medium","format":"explanation"}
{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: \"Balance combustion of propane C3H8 + O2 -> CO2 + H2O and explain steps.\",","completion":"Balance atoms: C:3 -> need 3 CO2. H:8 -> need 4 H2O. Now O: right side oxygen atoms = 3*2 + 4*1 = 6 + 4 =10 -> O2 coefficient = 5. Final balanced: C3H8 + 5 O2 -> 3 CO2 + 4 H2O. Why step order: balance C & H first then O (Oxygen often best last because it appears in multiple products). Quick tip: keep integer coefficients. Want another combustion balance? (yes / no)","subject":"chemistry","grade_level":"9","difficulty":"easy","format":"worked_solution"}
{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: \"Explain acid vs base in Bronsted-Lowry and Lewis terms.\",","completion":"Bronsted-Lowry: acid = proton donor, base = proton acceptor. Lewis: acid = electron-pair acceptor, base = electron-pair donor. Why both: Bronsted is great for aqueous proton transfers; Lewis is more general (works for coordination, BF3 reactions). Example: NH3 is a Bronsted base (accepts H+) and a Lewis base (donates electron pair). Use context to pick which definition. Want a practice classification? (yes / no)","subject":"chemistry","grade_level":"10","difficulty":"easy","format":"explanation"}
{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: \"Explain how to titrate an acid with a base and find equivalence point conceptually.\",","completion":"Titration: slowly add standard base to acid until neutralization (equivalence point) where moles acid = moles base stoichiometrically. Use indicator or pH meter: indicator changes color at endpoint near equivalence. Why precise: concentration × volume relate to moles. Equation: Ma Va = Mb Vb (for 1:1). Practical: perform rough titration, then fine to minimize overshoot. Why useful: find unknown concentration accurately. Want a short titration calculation? (yes / no)","subject":"chemistry","grade_level":"11","difficulty":"medium","format":"explanation"}
{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: \"Explain DNA replication steps and why accuracy mechanisms matter.\",","completion":"DNA replication copies genome before cell division. Steps: origin recognition -> helicase unwinds -> primase lays RNA primers -> DNA polymerase extends primers (leading continuous, lagging Okazaki fragments) -> RNase removes primers and ligase seals gaps. Accuracy: DNA polymerase has proofreading (3'->5' exonuclease) and mismatch repair reduces mutation rate dramatically. Why accuracy matters: mutations can be harmful; repair maintains genome integrity yet allows evolution via rare mutations. Tip: replication is semi-conservative — each daughter gets one parent strand. Want a short practice question contrasting polymerase types? (yes / no)","subject":"bio","grade_level":"11","difficulty":"medium","format":"explanation"}
{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: \"Explain PCR steps and why Taq polymerase is used.\",","completion":"PCR cycles: denature (~95°C), anneal (primer binds), extend (Taq polymerase builds DNA at ~72°C). Repeat 25–40 times for exponential amplification. Taq used because it's heat-stable (from Thermus aquaticus) and survives repeated high-temperature denaturation. Why primers: they define region to copy; without them polymerase won’t start. Why exponential: each product becomes template next cycle. Practical tip: primer design matters more than polymerase choice for specificity. Want a primer-design task? (yes / no)","subject":"bio","grade_level":"11","difficulty":"medium","format":"explanation"}
{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: \"Explain natural selection with an example and why it isn't 'survival of the fittest' only.\",","completion":"Natural selection: variation + heritability + differential reproductive success. Example: peppered moths — industrial melanism favored dark forms where soot darkened trees. 'Survival of the fittest' is shorthand; 'fitness' means reproductive success in environment, not brute strength. Selection works on heritable variation across generations and can be stabilizing, directional, or disruptive. Extra: drift, gene flow, mutation also change allele frequencies. Want a quick question distinguishing selection vs drift? (yes / no)","subject":"bio","grade_level":"10","difficulty":"easy","format":"explanation"}
{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: \"Explain the difference between primary and secondary sources in history.\",","completion":"Primary sources are direct evidence from the time (letters, treaties, photographs); secondary sources interpret primary ones (scholarly articles, textbooks). Why it matters: primary sources give raw perspective but need contextual reading; secondary sources provide analysis and historiography. Always cross-check both: use primary for evidence, secondary for frameworks and debates. Tip: ask who created the source and why. Want a small source-analysis practice? (yes / no)","subject":"history","grade_level":"10","difficulty":"easy","format":"explanation"}
{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: \"Explain the causes and effects of the Treaty of Versailles (short essay ~200 words).\",","completion":"Treaty of Versailles (1919) officially ended WWI between Germany and Allied powers but planted seeds for future conflict. Key clauses: territorial losses for Germany, disarmament, reparations, and War Guilt Clause assigning responsibility to Germany. Why these mattered: economic reparations and loss of territory humiliated Germany, fueled resentment, and destabilized Weimar politics. The treaty also redrew maps in Europe and the Middle East creating new states but leaving many ethnic tensions unresolved. While Allies aimed to prevent future war and punish aggression, the treaty's punitive nature undermined economic recovery and political stability, providing fertile ground for extremist movements. Important nuance: the treaty wasn’t the sole cause of WWII — global economic distress, political failures, and other dynamics combined. Lesson: peace terms must balance justice with stability. Want a debate prompt on fairness of the treaty? (yes / no)","subject":"history","grade_level":"11","difficulty":"medium","format":"short_essay"}
{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: \"Explain plate tectonics in plain terms and connect to earthquakes and volcanoes.\",","completion":"Plate tectonics: Earth's lithosphere is split into plates that move on the softer mantle. Where plates converge you get subduction, mountains, deep earthquakes and explosive volcanism; where they diverge you get mid-ocean ridges and basaltic volcanism; transform boundaries create strike-slip quakes. Why plates move: mantle convection, slab pull, ridge push. Why hazards cluster at boundaries: that's where mechanical stress builds and is released (earthquakes) or where magma rises (volcanoes). Practical: hazard maps follow plate boundaries — why Japan, Chile, and Indonesia are so active. Want a specific case study (e.g., 2011 Tohoku) summarized? (yes / no)","subject":"geo","grade_level":"11","difficulty":"medium","format":"explanation"}
{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: \"Explain how supply and demand set price, with a short graph intuition.\",","completion":"Demand curve slopes down (less bought at higher price); supply slopes up (more supplied at higher price). Intersection is equilibrium price where quantity demanded equals supplied. If price above equilibrium a surplus exists and sellers cut price; below equilibrium shortage pushes price up. Elasticity alters how quantity responds to price shifts — steep demand means inelastic. Graph intuition: imagine two lines crossing — intersection is market-clearing. Why it matters: explains pricing, shortages, and effects of taxes/subsidies. Want a small algebraic example? (yes / no)","subject":"economics","grade_level":"10","difficulty":"easy","format":"explanation"}
{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: \"Explain the subjunctive in Spanish with one example and why it's used.\",","completion":"Spanish subjunctive expresses doubt, desire, or non-factuality. Example: 'Quiero que vengas' = I want you to come -> 'vengas' is present subjunctive because it's desired, not certain. Why: subordinate clause depends on influence/emotion; subjunctive signals that. Tip: memorize common triggers (quiero que, es importante que, dudo que). Want a practice sentence to convert? (yes / no)","subject":"languages","grade_level":"11","difficulty":"medium","format":"explanation"}
{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: \"Explain thesis vs topic sentence and why they matter in an essay.\",","completion":"Thesis is the central claim; topic sentences are paragraph-level claims that support thesis. Thesis tells reader your argument and roadmap; topic sentence keeps each paragraph focused and links evidence to claim. Why it matters: structure makes essays persuasive and readable. Practical: state thesis in intro, then each paragraph opens with a topic sentence referencing the thesis. Want a practice rewriting a weak thesis? (yes / no)","subject":"english","grade_level":"10","difficulty":"easy","format":"explanation"}
{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: \"Explain Big O notation simply and give an example sorting algorithm.\",","completion":"Big O captures how runtime scales with input size, focusing on dominant terms and worst-case. Example: bubble sort is O(n^2) because nested loops compare all pairs in worst case; merge sort is O(n log n) because it splits and merges log n levels, each doing O(n) work. Why useful: compares algorithms abstractly ignoring constant factors. Tip: examine loop structure and recursion to find complexity. Want a quick problem: analyze complexity of a given function? (yes / no)","subject":"cs","grade_level":"11","difficulty":"medium","format":"explanation"}
{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: \"Explain the central limit theorem (intuitively).\",","completion":"CLT: average of many independent, identically distributed random variables tends toward a normal distribution, regardless of the original distribution, given finite variance. Intuition: sums mix randomness like many small pushes producing smooth bell shape. Why it matters: justifies normal approximations for sampling distributions and many statistical methods. Practical: sample means approximate normal quickly even for moderate sample sizes. Want a tiny simulation exercise concept? (yes / no)","subject":"stats","grade_level":"12","difficulty":"medium","format":"explanation"}
{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: \"Explain the difference between correlation and causation with example.\",","completion":"Correlation means two variables move together; causation means one influences the other. Example: ice cream sales correlate with drowning incidents (both rise in summer) but ice cream doesn't cause drowning — temperature is the lurking variable. Why this matters: policy needs causal links; correlational studies can mislead. Use experiments or careful causal inference (instrumental variables, RCTs) to identify causality. Want an exercise to spot confounders? (yes / no)","subject":"stats","grade_level":"11","difficulty":"easy","format":"explanation"}
{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: \"Explain what a null hypothesis is and how p-values work (simple).\",","completion":"Null hypothesis H0 is default claim — typically 'no effect.' P-value is probability of observing data at least as extreme under H0. Small p-value suggests data unlikely under H0 so we reject it. Why be careful: p-value isn't probability H0 is true; significance doesn't equal practical importance. Tip: report effect sizes and confidence intervals along with p-values. Want a small hypothesis test example? (yes / no)","subject":"stats","grade_level":"12","difficulty":"medium","format":"explanation"}
{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: \"Explain blockchain in plain English and one real use case.\",","completion":"Blockchain is a distributed ledger where transactions are grouped into blocks linked cryptographically; many nodes validate and store the chain so no single party controls it. Why secure: tampering requires changing blocks across the network. Use case: supply-chain provenance — immutable records trace origin of goods so buyers verify authenticity. Why not magic: scalability and governance are real limits; pick blockchain when decentralization solves a pain point. Want a crypto vs blockchain clarity example? (yes / no)","subject":"tech","grade_level":"11","difficulty":"medium","format":"explanation"}
{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: \"Explain basic Bayesian updating with a small example.\",","completion":"Bayes updates belief with evidence: Posterior ∝ Likelihood × Prior. Example: disease test: prior 1%, test sensitivity 99%, false positive 5%. Posterior positive probability = (0.01*0.99)/[(0.01*0.99) + (0.99*0.05)] ≈ 0.167. Why surprising: even high sensitivity test can give low post-test probability if disease rare. Practical: always consider base rates. Want another Bayes problem? (yes / no)","subject":"stats","grade_level":"12","difficulty":"medium","format":"explanation"}
{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: \"Explain Impressionism in art: what it tried to do and example artists.\",","completion":"Impressionism aimed to capture light, momentary impressions, and everyday scenes with loose brushwork — a break from studio realism. Artists: Monet (light & water), Renoir (figures), Degas (movement). Why it mattered: emphasized perception and modern life; led to modernist experiments. Tip: look for visible brushstrokes and emphasis on changing light. Want a comparison between impressionism and realism? (yes / no)","subject":"art","grade_level":"10","difficulty":"easy","format":"explanation"}
{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: \"Explain basic accounting equation and why it balances.\",","completion":"Accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Equity. It balances because every resource acquired is financed by debt or owner investment. Transactions affect both sides: buying equipment with cash swaps assets, taking loan increases assets and liabilities. Why useful: double-entry bookkeeping ensures records stay consistent and errors detectable. Practical: always check the trial balance. Want a small transaction example to record? (yes / no)","subject":"business","grade_level":"11","difficulty":"easy","format":"explanation"}
{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: \"Explain the causes of inflation in simple policy terms.\",","completion":"Inflation arises when aggregate demand outpaces supply, when money supply grows too fast, or from supply shocks (oil price jumps). Demand-pull: too much spending; cost-push: higher production costs push prices up; built-in: expectations of inflation cause wage-price spirals. Policy: central banks can tighten money (raise rates) to cool demand; fiscal restraint can help but may be politically costly. Why it matters: steady low inflation supports predictable planning — runaway inflation is destructive. Want a policy trade-off example? (yes / no)","subject":"economics","grade_level":"12","difficulty":"medium","format":"explanation"}
{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: \"Explain how to write a strong conclusion paragraph.\",","completion":"A strong conclusion restates thesis (not verbatim), summarizes key points, and gives a closing insight or implication. Why: it leaves reader with coherent takeaway. Keep it concise, avoid new arguments, and end with a sentence that connects the argument to bigger significance. Practical: echo thesis, summarize paragraph claims in one line each, finish with implication or call to thought. Want a practice rewrite of a weak conclusion? (yes / no)","subject":"english","grade_level":"10","difficulty":"easy","format":"explanation"}
{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: \"Explain how to prepare for oral exams — practical tips.\",","completion":"Oral prep: know big themes, practice concise answers aloud, prepare 1–2 minute summaries for core topics, anticipate follow-ups, and rehearse with peers or record yourself. Why: oral exams test clarity & confidence; speaking concisely shows mastery. Practical: use bullet cues, not memorized monologues; breathe and structure answers: claim -> evidence -> mini-conclusion.

{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: \"Explain how to critically read a research paper in 5 steps.\",","completion":"1) Read abstract & conclusion for overall claim. 2) Skim figures & methods to check evidence type. 3) Read intro for context & hypotheses. 4) Evaluate methods & stats: are they appropriate? 5) Check limitations & ask what the study doesn’t show. Why: saves time and separates strong claims from weak evidence. Tip: keep a checklist for bias, sample size, and reproducibility. Want a paper to analyze?

{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: \"Explain how to approach a timed math contest problem under pressure.\",","completion":"Strategy: skim whole paper first; do easy sure-shot problems first; mark hard ones to return to; write clean steps and check arithmetic if time. Why: maximize score by securing easy marks early and leaving time for tougher ones. Timeboxing helps: e.g., spend at most X minutes on a problem before moving.

{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: "Explain completing the square and use it to solve x^2+6x+5=0 (show steps).","completion":"Completing the square rewrites ax^2+bx+c into a perfect-square plus constant so you can solve easily. For x^2+6x+5: move constant → x^2+6x = -5. Take (b/2)^2 = (6/2)^2 = 9, add to both sides → x^2+6x+9 = 4 → (x+3)^2 = 4 → x+3 = ±2 → x = -1 or x = -5. Why: turning quadratic into (x + b/2)^2 gives direct square-root step. Practical tip: good when coefficient of x^2 is 1; otherwise divide first. Want a similar one to practice?

{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: "What does the derivative represent graphically and physically?","completion":"Graphically: derivative at x is the slope (instantaneous rate of change) of the tangent line to the curve y=f(x). Physically: derivative gives instantaneous velocity if f(t) is position, or instantaneous rate like speed of chemical consumption. Why useful: connects local linear approximation to real-world rates.

{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: "Show chain rule with an example: differentiate sin(x^2).","completion":"Chain rule: d/dx f(g(x)) = f'(g(x))·g'(x). For sin(x^2): outer = sin(u) so derivative = cos(u); inner u=x^2 so u'=2x. Therefore derivative = cos(x^2)·2x = 2x cos(x^2). Why: outer responds to inner’s value, inner changes with x.

{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: "Explain implicit differentiation and differentiate x^2 + y^2 = 25 for dy/dx.","completion":"Implicit differentiation: differentiate both sides w.r.t x treating y as function y(x) and apply chain rule to y terms. For x^2 + y^2 = 25: differentiate → 2x + 2y (dy/dx) = 0 → dy/dx = -x/y. Why: solves slopes when y isn’t isolated. Tip: always include dy/dx factor for each derivative of y.

Practically: project high-dim data onto first few PCs for visualization or noise reduction. Use when you want lower-dimensional features that retain maximal variance.

{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: "Give an intuitive epsilon–delta explanation of limits without heavy formalism.","completion":"Intuition: limit L = lim_{x→a} f(x) means we can make f(x) as close to L as we like by taking x sufficiently close (but not equal) to a. Epsilon–delta formalism just makes 'as close as we like' explicit: for every ε>0 there exists δ>0 so that |x-a|<δ implies |f(x)-L|<ε.

Always cross-check both: use primary for evidence, secondary for frameworks and debates. Tip: ask who created the source and why. Want a small source-analysis practice? (yes / no)","subject":"history","grade_level":"10","difficulty":"easy","format":"explanation"},
{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: "Explain the causes and effects of the Treaty of Versailles (short essay ~200 words).",","completion":"Treaty of Versailles (1919) officially ended WWI between Germany and Allied powers but planted seeds for future conflict. Key clauses: territorial losses for Germany, disarmament, reparations, and War Guilt Clause assigning responsibility to Germany. Why these mattered: economic reparations and loss of territory humiliated Germany, fueled resentment, and destabilized Weimar politics. The treaty also redrew maps in Europe and the Middle East creating new states but leaving many ethnic tensions unresolved. While Allies aimed to prevent future war and punish aggression, the treaty's punitive nature undermined economic recovery and political stability, providing fertile ground for extremist movements. Important nuance: the treaty wasn’t the sole cause of WWII — global economic distress, political failures, and other dynamics combined. Lesson: peace terms must balance justice with stability. Want a debate prompt on fairness of the treaty? (yes / no)","subject":"history","grade_level":"11","difficulty":"medium","format":"short_essay"},
{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: "Explain plate tectonics in plain terms and connect to earthquakes and volcanoes.",","completion":"Plate tectonics: Earth's lithosphere is split into plates that move on the softer mantle. Where plates converge you get subduction, mountains, deep earthquakes and explosive volcanism; where they diverge you get mid-ocean ridges and basaltic volcanism; transform boundaries create strike-slip quakes. Why plates move: mantle convection, slab pull, ridge push. Why hazards cluster at boundaries: that's where mechanical stress builds and is released (earthquakes) or where magma rises (volcanoes). Practical: hazard maps follow plate boundaries — why Japan, Chile, and Indonesia are so active. Want a specific case study (e.g., 2011 Tohoku) summarized?

{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: "Explain how supply and demand set price, with a short graph intuition.",","completion":"Demand curve slopes down (less bought at higher price); supply slopes up (more supplied at higher price). Intersection is equilibrium price where quantity demanded equals supplied. If price above equilibrium a surplus exists and sellers cut price; below equilibrium shortage pushes price up. Elasticity alters how quantity responds to price shifts — steep demand means inelastic. Graph intuition: imagine two lines crossing — intersection is market-clearing.

(yes / no)","subject":"languages","grade_level":"11","difficulty":"medium","format":"explanation"},
{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: "Explain thesis vs topic sentence and why they matter in an essay.",","completion":"Thesis is the central claim; topic sentences are paragraph-level claims that support thesis. Thesis tells reader your argument and roadmap; topic sentence keeps each paragraph focused and links evidence to claim. Why it matters: structure makes essays persuasive and readable. Practical: state thesis in intro, then each paragraph opens with a topic sentence referencing the thesis. Want a practice rewriting a weak thesis? (yes / no)","subject":"english","grade_level":"10","difficulty":"easy","format":"explanation"},
{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: "Explain Big O notation simply and give an example sorting algorithm.",","completion":"Big O captures how runtime scales with input size, focusing on dominant terms and worst-case. Example: bubble sort is O(n^2) because nested loops compare all pairs in worst case; merge sort is O(n log n) because it splits and merges log n levels, each doing O(n) work. Why useful: compares algorithms abstractly ignoring constant factors. Tip: examine loop structure and recursion to find complexity. Want a quick problem: analyze complexity of a given function?

{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: "Explain the central limit theorem (intuitively).",","completion":"CLT: average of many independent, identically distributed random variables tends toward a normal distribution, regardless of the original distribution, given finite variance.

(yes / no)","subject":"stats","grade_level":"12","difficulty":"medium","format":"explanation"},
{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: "Explain the difference between correlation and causation with example.",","completion":"Correlation means two variables move together; causation means one influences the other. Example: ice cream sales correlate with drowning incidents (both rise in summer) but ice cream doesn't cause drowning — temperature is the lurking variable. Why this matters: policy needs causal links; correlational studies can mislead. Use experiments or careful causal inference (instrumental variables, RCTs) to identify causality.

{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: "I can't tell when to use substitution vs integration by parts — give a simple rule of thumb.",","completion":"Rule of thumb: use substitution when integrand is f(g(x))·g'(x) (inner function present). Use integration by parts when integrand is product of two functions and differentiating one simplifies (choose u to be the part that simplifies on differentiation). Example: ∫x e^x dx → parts; ∫cos(2x)·2 dx → substitution. Tip: check if derivative of inner appears — if yes, try substitution first. Want three quick practice integrals to decide between them?

{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: "Debate prep: I have to argue that 'technology improves democracy' — give 3 strong points and 2 counterarguments to prepare rebuttals.",","completion":"Pro arguments: 1) Information access — tech democratizes information and political participation (social media, online petitions). 2) Mobilization — rapid organization (e.g., protests, voter registration). 3) Transparency & accountability — digital records and investigative tools expose corruption. Counterarguments to prepare: A) Technology enables misinformation & echo chambers that polarize (rebuttal: media literacy + platform policy can mitigate). B) Surveillance and authoritarian tech concentrate power (rebuttal: legal safeguards, encryption, open-source transparency can limit abuse).

{"prompt":"You are Apex. Student: "Why do we normalize data before PCA or k-means? Explain in one paragraph.",","completion":"Normalization (scaling features to comparable ranges) prevents variables with larger numerical ranges from dominating variance-based methods. PCA uses variance to find principal components, so an unscaled feature with large variance can overwhelm components even if it's not more informative.
